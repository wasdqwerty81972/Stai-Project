# Retention offers: pause and downgrade

Retention offers appear inside the in-app cancellation dialog after the user
has answered the cancellation survey. Each offer has its own PostHog flag and
fails closed to the plain cancel flow:

| Offer     | Flag                                                               | Env override                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pause     | `hac-96-pause-subscription-offer`                                  | `PAUSE_OFFER_ENABLED`                                          |
| Downgrade | `hac-97-downgrade-offer` (variants `price_reasons`, `all_reasons`) | `DOWNGRADE_OFFER_ENABLED` (`true`, `false`, or a variant name) |

## Downgrade offer

Pro+ and Ultra monthly cancellers citing "too expensive", "not using it
enough", or "other" are offered one tier down (Pro+ → Pro, Ultra → Pro+).
Boomerang data drove this shape: most Pro+ and Ultra cancellers who come back
re-subscribe to the cheaper tier.

Accepting schedules the change for the end of the paid period through a
Stripe Subscription Schedule (`lib/billing/subscription-schedule.ts`): phase 1
keeps the current items until the paid-through date, phase 2 switches to the
cheaper price for one period with `proration_behavior: none`, and
`end_behavior: release` hands the subscription back to normal renewals on the
new price. Nothing is charged or credited today. The phase metadata sets
`checkoutSource=retention_downgrade` on the subscription when it switches, so
the webhook's tier-change handling and `subscription_changed` work unchanged.

Creation is two Stripe calls (`create` from the subscription, then `update`
with the phases) under one idempotency key per acceptance; if the update fails
the bare schedule is released again so nothing stays attached.

Account status expands `data.schedule` only (Stripe caps expansion at four
levels) and fetches the pending phase price separately.

While a schedule is attached Stripe rejects direct item changes, so cancel,
pause, keep, and plan changes call `releaseSubscriptionSchedule` first.
"Keep current plan" in Account settings releases it and emits
`retention_downgrade_canceled`. A subscription with a schedule attached is not
offered another downgrade (`downgrade_already_scheduled`). The Convex
cancellation row is marked `retained`.

Analytics: `retention_offer_evaluated` gains `downgrade_offered`,
`downgrade_ineligibility_reason`, and `downgrade_target_plan`;
`retention_offer_impressed` lists both offers in `offers_shown`;
`retention_offer_accepted` with `retention_offer=downgrade` and
`retention_downgrade_scheduled` record acceptance; the webhook's
`subscription_changed` carries `source=retention_downgrade`.

## What the user sees

1. Reason and follow-up survey (unchanged).
2. Offer step listing the eligible offers as selectable options (downgrade
   first, then pause with a 1/2/3 month picker), one primary button for the
   selected option, and a "No thanks, continue to cancel" link to the
   existing confirmation step.
3. Account settings shows **Pause scheduled** with **Cancel pause** until the
   paid-through date, and **Your plan is paused / Resume now** afterwards.

Eligibility lives in `lib/billing/retention-offers.ts`: Pro, Pro+, or Ultra;
monthly; single seat; subscription `active` or `trialing`; no cancellation
already scheduled; reason is too expensive, not using enough, hit usage
limits, temporary pause, or other; no pause requested in the last 180 days.

## How a pause works

Stripe's native pause endpoint is preview-only and `pause_collection` keeps the
subscription (and therefore WorkOS entitlements and usage refills) active, so a
pause is modelled as a scheduled cancellation plus an automatic resume:

1. `POST /api/billing/pause` schedules `cancel_at_period_end`, writes pause
   metadata (`hackeraiPause*`) on the Stripe subscription, and inserts a
   `subscription_pauses` row (`scheduled`).
2. The subscription stays fully usable until the paid-through date.
3. `customer.subscription.deleted` marks the row `paused`; the user drops to
   the free tier through the normal WorkOS entitlement sync.
4. The hourly Vercel cron `/api/cron/subscription-pauses` re-creates the
   subscription with the same price and the saved payment method on
   `resume_at`. The Convex claim (`claimResume`) is atomic, so overlapping runs
   and the "Resume now" button cannot double-bill.
5. The resulting `invoice.paid` (`subscription_create`, metadata
   `checkoutType=pause_resume`) refills usage credits and is reported as a
   reactivation, not a new paid start.

Failure handling:

- Card declined on the automatic path: retried daily, up to 3 attempts, then
  `resume_failed`. Account settings shows "Resume now" so the user can retry
  after updating their card.
- No saved payment method: `resume_failed` immediately; the user is pointed to
  the pricing page.
- The customer already has a live subscription: the pause is `superseded`.

Users can cancel a scheduled pause with the existing **Keep plan** action
(shown as **Cancel pause**), which also clears the Stripe metadata.

## Analytics

Events (all carry `paid_funnel_event_version`):

- `retention_offer_evaluated` (server, every offers request) with
  `pause_offer_flag_state` (`enabled` / `disabled` / `unavailable`),
  `pause_offered`, and `pause_ineligibility_reason`; the first place to look
  when a canceller did not see the offer
- `retention_offer_impressed` (client, exposure) with `offers_shown`
- `retention_offer_accepted` / `retention_offer_declined`
- `subscription_pause_scheduled`, `subscription_pause_canceled`,
  `subscription_pause_resumed`, `subscription_pause_resume_failed`
- Existing `cancellation_completed` and `subscription_cancelled` gain
  `retention_pause=true` when the cancellation is a pause.
- `subscription_started` gets `conversion_type=pause_resume` and zeroed
  paid-start counters on resume.

The Convex cancellation report now includes `pausedCount` per reason group.

## Environment

- `PAUSE_OFFER_ENABLED=true|false` overrides the PostHog flag (local dev or
  kill switch). Leave unset in production. A flag lookup that times out is
  retried once, then logged as `pause_offer_flag_unavailable` and treated as
  disabled.
- `CRON_SECRET` protects the resume cron, like the existing platform-cost crons.
- The Convex schema adds the `subscription_pauses` table; deploy Convex before
  enabling the flag.

## Downgrade reason policy

The downgrade flag is multivariate. `price_reasons` (the default, and what a
boolean `true` maps to) shows the offer for "too expensive", "not using it
enough", and "other". `all_reasons` shows it for every reason except "hit
usage limits", where a cheaper tier would make the problem worse. The variant
is recorded as `downgrade_offer_variant` on `retention_offer_evaluated`,
`retention_offer_accepted`, and `retention_downgrade_scheduled`, so acceptance
by reason can be compared per variant.
