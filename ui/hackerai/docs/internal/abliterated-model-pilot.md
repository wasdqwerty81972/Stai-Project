# Moderation-gated Abliteration pilot

Owner and rollout decisions: [HAC-99](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-99).
[Production readout dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/project/144137/dashboard/2070216).
The dashboard includes an assigned-model volume diagnostic
([insight gRZGMouh](https://us.posthog.com/project/144137/insights/gRZGMouh))
so base and Large v2 traffic can be checked independently.

## Free rollout phase

The free Agent group of Production flag 869145 enrolls 100% of eligible users
with control/test 50/50 (50% each, no outside group). Paid criteria are unchanged.
Preview flag 869147 remains 100% of eligible test users with forced treatment.

The separate free Ask flag enrolls authenticated free users; code additionally
requires the existing moderation signal and supported inputs. Production is
prepared with enrollment 100%, control/test 50/50, and remains inactive until the
free Ask implementation is deployed and verified. Preview enrolls 100%
for acceptance testing. Record actual flag IDs, activation and cohort boundaries
in HAC-103. Keep the retired DeepSeek-vs-GLM Ask flag disabled.

Analyze Ask and Agent separately by experiment key and mode. The same user may
enter both experiments; report overlap for conversion/retention attribution.
Feedback reservations persist their actual experiment key; old reservations
without a key remain attributed to the original experiment. The existing
feedback cooldown and UI stay unchanged. Review health 24h after activation and
outcomes with equal seven-day follow-up; record inconclusive results honestly.

## Routing contract

Paid and free requests in Ask and Agent may use an Abliteration model at
`https://api.abliteration.ai/v1`. Auto/Standard routes use `abliterated-model`;
explicit HackerAI Pro and Max routes use `abliterated-model-large-v2`. Ultra Ask
Auto also uses Large v2 because its current baseline is Pro, while Ultra Agent
Auto uses the base model because its baseline is Standard. The existing moderation
API normally selects the experiment through `shouldUncensorResponse=true`.
The separately flagged recent-chat preference below can retain the provider when
the new moderation score falls below the minimum routing threshold; it never
relaxes forbidden categories, upper score limits, tool approvals, or authorization.

Abliteration is limited to the first model-generation step within each
Ask response or Agent run. The shared AI SDK loop uses the assigned Abliteration
model for zero-based step index 0, then switches step 2 and every later step to
the request's saved OpenRouter baseline. The counter resets for each new response
or run; an Agent run can continue through its existing 500-step cap. Provider retry
attempts do not advance the completed-step counter. An Abliteration provider error
still disables the treatment route immediately for the replacement stream.

Because Large v2 is text-only, image attachments and image-view tool results use
the multimodal base `abliterated-model` for every selector, including Pro and Max.
PDFs, files without an image media type, and other unsupported file inputs retain
their original HackerAI route.

Requests with more than four provider-visible images use batched auxiliary
descriptions/OCR. Smaller requests keep native images unless Abliteration rejects
them before streaming with `media_dimensions_too_large` (413) or
`media_type_unsupported` (415). Those two rejections activate the same OCR path
and one retry on the selected Abliteration model. Original stored images remain
unchanged. Failed OCR is not restarted; moderation blocks, generic errors and
errors after streaming starts do not activate this recovery. Provider-attempt
telemetry retains the rejection and the subsequent outcome separately.

Explicit free-allowance rescue requests are excluded before assignment. Eligibility
is recorded before model-priced budget checks so cost-induced blocking cannot
silently remove treatment users from the denominator.

Paid daily free-allowance rescue requests are excluded. Free Agent
treatment uses the base model and preserves its exact free OpenRouter baseline
for control, later steps and provider recovery. Existing free quota/concurrency
checks and local-sandbox entitlement still apply; this does not grant cloud access.
Free Ask uses the separate `abliterated_free_ask_moderated_v1` flag
([HAC-103](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-103)). It compares the fixed
`ask-model-free-glm` baseline (GLM 5.3 Flash low) with base Abliteration, using
the same moderation, supported-file, first-step and prompt-annotation contract.
The exact GLM baseline returns on later steps and errors; free Ask keeps low
reasoning on OpenRouter recovery. Missing/disabled Ask flags never inherit the
Agent assignment. Free Ask cannot qualify through paid chat-history continuity.

Every control retains its exact existing baseline. Analyze provider model,
selector, subscription, input modality, and mode separately as well as overall.

`ABLITERATION_API_KEY` is a server credential. Missing credentials, missing flags,
unknown variants, and flag lookup errors preserve the existing route. Only an
explicit `test` assignment selects Abliteration. A `control` assignment preserves
the baseline model. Assignment uses the authenticated user ID, not a request ID.
Feature-flag evaluation does not emit an exposure event.

For the Abliteration treatment, provider-bound preparation does not append the
trusted platform-authorization annotation. Forged authorization tags are still
removed. Sandbox/resume reminders, saved notes, the normal system prompt, tools,
and later agent-loop messages retain their existing behavior. Control and fallback
providers retain their existing platform-authorization preparation.

The provider uses the OpenAI-compatible AI SDK adapter, streaming usage, and native
default reasoning. OpenRouter options, routing lists, user attribution, and PDF
plugins are not sent to the direct endpoint. Existing bounded application retries
use the request's original baseline after an Abliteration failure. Subagents,
summaries, titles, and approval reviewers retain their existing models.

## Recent-chat continuity

`abliteration_chat_continuity_v1` retains Abliteration for paid parent-treatment
requests when at least two of the last five completed visible assistant responses
in the same chat independently used it. A completed response has `finish_reason=stop`;
a seed additionally requires a successfully finished Abliteration generation and
no response abort. Failed attempts, empty output, controls, fallback-only output,
and inherited selections never seed the preference. Two independently selected
responses are enough even when the chat has fewer than five completed responses.

The new input still runs through moderation. Missing credentials, API failures,
invalid scores, forbidden categories, and scores above the existing upper bound
fail closed. This preference only bypasses the lower routing threshold; it does
not set `platformAuthorized`. Existing plan, rescue, attachment, provider-fallback,
and one-generation-step restrictions apply. Regenerations do not inherit history.

Provenance is stored as `usage.abliterationRouting` (version, source, completed),
inside the existing flexible usage object, without a schema migration. The server
tracks successful Abliteration generation even when later steps use OpenRouter;
the final saved model alone is insufficient evidence. Client stop-save strips
this reserved field, and only the service-key save path can persist it. Legacy
responses without this marker are deliberately not seeds.

History metadata comes from the existing bounded backend page reads, separately
from model messages and before token truncation or summary projection. No full-chat
scan or extra database round trip is added. If bounded fetching reaches fewer than
five completed responses, only available evidence is used; missing evidence does
not count. As seeds leave the five-response window, inherited responses cannot
renew them.

Telemetry adds `selection_source` (`moderation` or `history`),
`independent_history_count`, and `routing_version=2` to the existing eligibility,
actual exposure, and provider outcome events. `moderation_eligible` reflects the
independent moderation decision. Compare completion, latency, estimated cost,
fallback/error/abort rates, and task feedback by routing source, mode and model.
History traffic is selected from prior treatment: it is not a randomized causal
comparison against parent controls. Churn and retention need a later user-level
readout with enough follow-up time. No user content is added to analytics.

Owner: Ross Manko, [HAC-99](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-99).
Review Preview results before Production activation; initial review 2026-09-14.
Roll back via the continuity flag on completion/feedback regression, elevated
cost or latency, or any moderation/persistence failure. Remove the continuity
flag with the parent pilot after an explicit decision.

Definitions verified 2026-09-07:

| Environment | Project               | Flag   | Active | Rollout | Target                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Preview     | hackerai-dev / 401167 | 870188 | Yes    | 100%    | Paid tiers; application also requires parent treatment |
| Production  | HackerAI / 144137     | 870186 | No     | 0%      | Paid tiers; no Production continuity activation        |

Both use `abliteration_chat_continuity_v1` and target `pro`, `pro-plus`, `ultra`,
and `team`. The parent flag remains unchanged. This implementation requires
Convex functions, Vercel and Trigger Preview deployments before end-to-end testing;
subsequent flag changes take effect on a new request/run.

Manual verification in the designated Preview branch: use a disposable paid chat,
complete two independently moderation-selected responses, then submit a benign
follow-up below the minimum routing score. Confirm `selection_source=history`,
completion and reload persistence, and OpenRouter on generation step two. Confirm
regeneration and an expired history window retain normal routing; check moderation
failure and forbidden-category exclusions with deterministic automated fixtures.
Do not seed routing markers by editing live user messages.

## Environment and rollout record

Definitions read back on 2026-09-08 after free Agent enrollment was expanded
and the separate free Ask flags were prepared.

| Environment | PostHog project       | Flag ID | Key                               | Configured rollout                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Preview     | hackerai-dev / 401167 | 869147  | abliterated_paid_moderated_v1     | Active; 100% of eligible paid and free Agent users, forced test          |
| Production  | HackerAI / 144137     | 869145  | abliterated_paid_moderated_v1     | Active; 100% enrollment, 50/50 control/test, approximately 50% treatment |
| Preview     | hackerai-dev / 401167 | 872124  | abliterated_free_ask_moderated_v1 | Active; 100% eligible free enrollment, 50/50 control/test                |
| Production  | HackerAI / 144137     | 872126  | abliterated_free_ask_moderated_v1 | Inactive pending deployment; saved 100% enrollment, 50/50 control/test   |

Paid groups target `subscription_tier` in `pro`, `pro-plus`, `ultra`, `team`.
The free Agent extension adds a separate `subscription_tier=free` group, with the
mode enforced in code before any flag evaluation. The legacy flag key is retained
to preserve stable assignment and analytics joins. Free Ask never evaluates it.
The server supplies the current trusted subscription and enforces the remaining
eligibility checks. Production evaluates the explicit test-user override first,
then the broader paid-user experiment group. Keep override traffic out of the
causal readout. Never apply Preview's 100% test split to Production.

Before any deployment/configuration work, independently verify the intended
Convex account, project, designated deployment, URL, and custom domain, and the
checkout/CLI selecting them. Preview belongs only to HackerAI Developer's
designated Preview deployment; Production belongs only to HackerAI's designated
Production deployment. Resolve Vercel and Trigger independently. Do not copy local
Convex state or credentials between environments/checkouts.

Vercel and Trigger each need their own explicitly authorized environment setting
for `ABLITERATION_API_KEY`. Verify the worker's actual PostHog project key, not just
the Vercel setting. Local credential presence in both developer folders was checked;
remote credentials and runtime project selections remain unverified.

Routing-code changes need a new Vercel deployment and a new Trigger worker
deployment. A flag-only change is evaluated on the next Ask request or new Agent
run; it does not reroute an already-running stream.

## Event contract

All new server events carry `experiment_key`, `experiment_variant`,
`$feature/abliterated_paid_moderated_v1`, `experiment_request_id`, mode, tier,
and `generation_step_limit`. Provider-outcome events also
carry the one-based `generation_step` and `within_abliteration_step_limit`.
Eligibility identifies `assigned_platform_authorization_context`; each retained provider
outcome identifies its actual `platform_authorization_context` as `not_appended`
for an Abliteration model or `standard` for a control/fallback provider.
The request ID is the original assistant-message ID and stays stable across
provider retries. No new event contains prompts, answers, reasoning, targets,
tool names/arguments, files, raw provider errors, or credentials.

| Event                                  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `abliterated_model_provider_attempt`   | Legacy telemetry v1 only; v2 counts calls in the response summary                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `abliterated_model_exposed`            | First streamed nonempty text or accepted tool call; once per response, including control/fallback with actual model attribution                                                                                                                          |
| `abliterated_model_provider_outcome`   | First-step outcomes and every empty, error, aborted, incomplete, content-filtered or truncated outcome at later steps; duration, first-content latency, text/reasoning lengths, tool-call count, reported token/cache counts and estimated provider cost |

| `chat_response_stop_requested`         | Client Stop action, with affected message ID and mode; distinct from confirmed cancellation                                                                                                                                                              |

Telemetry v2 removes attempt events and successful continuation events. The
existing response-outcome event includes request-wide `provider_attempt_count`,
`provider_outcome_count`, `provider_pending_count`, per-outcome counts, requested
Abliteration/baseline attempt counts, continuation completion count, duration,
tool-call count, token/cache/reasoning totals, and `provider_estimated_cost_dollars`.
Counters remain stable across fallback message replacement and include retries;
they do not represent unique generation steps. `provider_usage_reported_count`
counts attempts with both input and output totals available for the cost estimate.
Missing usage is not an assertion of zero cost. These totals cover the wrapped
main response providers, not unwrapped subagents or image-summary helper calls.

Eligibility, actual exposure, first-step outcomes for both variants, exceptional
outcomes at every step, feedback, and final response outcomes remain unsampled.
A process terminated before final analytics may lose its in-memory summary; retain
eligible requests without a terminal event in the readout. No new per-step array
or user content is collected. Normal routing and billing are unchanged.

For charts, do not use the remaining provider-outcome event count as the total
call denominator. Use sums of v2 response totals, deduplicated by
`experiment_request_id`. For first-step quality/latency, filter
`generation_step=1` for both telemetry versions. Historical spend uses v1
provider-outcome cost; v2 spend uses response-summary cost. Never add v2 detailed
outcome cost to v2 summary cost, which would double-count first steps and errors.
The provider-failure chart remains compatible because all exceptional outcomes
are retained. A drop in diagnostic events at deployment is intentional.

Exposure means content entered the application stream, not confirmed browser
delivery or task usefulness. Reasoning-only output does not count. A completed
tool-call step does not establish that the overall request succeeded.

Existing `hackerai-usage_cost`, usage settlement, and Agent outcome events retain
the assigned variant even after fallback. Existing `message_feedback_submitted`
joins through `message_id`; use eligible/exposure/message-link events to resolve
replacement message IDs. Billing and later activity join by authenticated
`distinct_id`, without re-evaluating the flag at cancellation time.

## Readout protocol

The one-step phase emits `generation_step_limit=1` on eligibility and provider
events; the earlier three-step phase emitted `3`. Scope each readout by that
property on deduplicated eligible requests, then link all outcomes by
`experiment_request_id`. Compare control/test within the same phase, and do not
pool phases or treat before/after changes as randomized evidence. Production
activation starts with the first verified one-step run, not the Git merge time.

1. Freeze the rollout definition and record the first production exposure date.
   Compare randomized control/test users only. Do not compare treatment with all
   unassigned users. Exclude internal tests and report any assignment crossover.
2. Deduplicate `(distinct_id, experiment_request_id)` from eligible events.
   Left-join final response outcomes and the final provider-call outcome. Missing
   terminal events remain in the denominator and are reported as unknown/failure,
   never silently removed. Primary success requires application success and a
   nonempty final answer; tool-only completion is not sufficient.
3. Report successful nonempty responses per eligible request, absolute differences
   and uncertainty with user-level clustering. Also report unique exposed users,
   eligible requests, mode/tier composition, and per-user request counts. The
   dashboard's raw event counts and per-call metrics are diagnostics, not substitutes
   for the deduplicated primary analysis.
4. Compare linked positive/negative feedback, feedback participation, regeneration,
   Stop, latency, empty/truncated answers, fallback and error rates. Feedback is
   self-selected; nonempty answers are not proof of usefulness. User-level funnel
   charts intentionally include later actions on other models; link messages for
   response-specific conclusions.
5. Sum per-attempt estimated provider spend before dividing by successful eligible
   requests. Failed legs may be refunded/discarded from customer billing; billed
   cost alone understates provider spend. Calls without reported usage have unknown
   cost, not zero. Reconcile with provider billing before expanding. Also compare
   existing billed usage, budget exhaustion and usage-limit pressure.
6. Anchor retention at the user's first eligible request. D1/D7/D30 activity means
   later `hackerai-usage_cost` activity in either Ask or Agent, regardless of model.
   Compare only fully observed 24-hour windows. Do not count recent, immature users
   as churned. Keep monthly/yearly plans and prior tenure separate in the final readout.
7. Measure cancellation intent with `cancellation_completed`; actual subscription
   loss with `subscription_cancelled`. Exclude `retention_pause=true`, separate
   voluntary/involuntary churn, and remove pre-existing cancellation intent from
   incident-churn analysis. Track `subscription_changed`, pause/reversal, and payment
   recovery separately. Use unique at-risk users as denominator, not message counts.
   Dashboard churn funnels are provisional until cohorts mature; renewals may need
   a longer window than D30, especially annual plans.

Operational review: seven days after launch. Retention review: matured D7 and D30
cohorts. Never claim a churn improvement from a small early sample or a nonsignificant
result. No automatic rollout ramp. The owner must record the readout in HAC-99.

Disable the flag on any safety/authorization regression or repeated provider
failures. Investigate >2 percentage points of added failures, >25% p95 latency
regression, or >25% cost-per-success regression; do not wait for statistical
significance during an incident. Final rollout decisions must weigh quality gains
against additional cost. Remove the flag and losing provider path after the final
decision, targeting cleanup within 60 days of launch.

## Verification

Run the bounded live provider test from this checkout:

```sh
corepack pnpm exec tsx scripts/test-abliteration.ts
corepack pnpm exec tsx scripts/test-abliteration.ts --large-v2
```

It loads only the provider credential, uses synthetic arithmetic and an in-memory
tool, exercises the registered provider plus tool IDs and telemetry, caps output
and duration, and does not ingest PostHog events. It is not full app verification.

For release verification on the verified Preview custom URL:

1. Use a disposable paid-user Ask chat and an eligible synthetic authorized lab
   request. Confirm moderation eligibility, streaming completion, model attribution,
   one exposure, and reload persistence. Repeat in Agent with one bounded tool call.
2. Confirm benign/unflagged requests, prohibited-category moderation results,
   moderation failure, PDFs, other unsupported files, and free-allowance
   rescue keep their baseline routes. Confirm image requests use the base Abliteration
   model for Standard, Pro, and Max while text-only Pro/Max requests use Large v2.
   Unit tests cover deterministic gates; use approved synthetic fixtures for
   integration testing rather than customer content.
   In Direct Ask and Agent, force one response/run through at least three sequential
   model-generation steps. Confirm step 1 uses the assigned Abliteration route and
   step 2 onward uses the exact OpenRouter baseline without flag re-evaluation. Start
   a new response/run and confirm its generation-step counter starts again at one.
3. Force the flag off/control and a provider outage. Verify fallback completes,
   assignment stays unchanged in outcomes/costs, replacement messages can be rated,
   and no duplicate tool action occurs.
4. Stop, regenerate, rate, reload, and reconnect the disposable response. Confirm
   message linkage, terminal outcomes, token/cost attribution, and no content in
   analytics. Clean up the test chats. Repeat the bounded journey on the production
   custom domain for the explicit test-user override and sampled treatment cohort
   before any further rollout expansion.

## Free Agent pilot

Free Agent rollout is governed by HAC-99. Production flag 869145 now enrolls
100% of eligible free users with control/test 50/50, matching the free rollout
phase above. Existing paid groups and their internal override are unchanged.
Preview flag 869147 targets all eligible free Agent testers with forced treatment.
The activation timestamp, previous cohort boundaries, and runtime evidence are
recorded in HAC-99.

Compare free control/test users separately from paid users and from earlier routing
phases. Prioritize useful results, linked thumbs, and task-outcome ratings only
where the separate survey flag already permits them. Missing ratings are unknown.
Track completion, return usage, free-to-paid conversion, quota exhaustion, provider
fallbacks, tool failures and cost per completed task. Paid churn does not apply to
free users. Do not widen the survey flag as part of the provider rollout.

Review the free cohort operationally on 2026-09-08 and review quality on 2026-09-14;
keep uncertainty and mature retention windows explicit. Remove the free flag group
to roll back just this cohort. No automatic ramp. Full temporary survey removal
at experiment conclusion remains mandatory under HAC-101.

Verify a free Agent test and control on the designated Preview: completed first
step, exact free baseline on step two, provider failure recovery, original request
attribution, unchanged quotas and sandbox permissions, and reload persistence.
Also verify free Ask evaluates only its separate Ask flag and missing/off/unknown
flags retain baseline. Use a free test account with a connected local sandbox, then
verify a bounded production free-cohort run before expansion.
