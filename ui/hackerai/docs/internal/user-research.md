# Internal user research pipeline

The PM-facing entry point is the Trigger.dev task `pm-user-research`, normally
called through the repo-owned Codex skill `$hackerai-user-research`.

## What it does

1. Accepts an authorized PM's research question and 1-20 internal user IDs
   selected entirely from PostHog. The scoped PM gateway key establishes access;
   no separate per-run approval record is required. A Linear issue is optional
   tracking metadata and does not authorize or block a run.
2. Uses service-keyed Convex queries to sample up to 20 chats across each user's
   observed date range, or within a bounded pre-event window when every cohort
   member has an event timestamp.
3. Reads bounded text excerpts from the beginning and end of each chat. The
   excerpt query excludes files, tool outputs, reasoning parts, hidden/system
   messages, and message/chat identifiers.
4. Redacts direct identifiers, targets, secrets, paths, code blocks, and command
   arguments before sending evidence to the model.
5. Runs one profile worker per user in parallel, then synthesizes the cohort.
   Comparative runs preserve 2-4 PostHog-selected groups, but expose only
   sanitized labels and pseudonyms to synthesis.
6. Stores the audit record, bounded PostHog cohort provenance, structured
   per-user profiles keyed by internal user ID, aggregate report, evidence
   coverage, token usage, and provider cost in Convex. The audit stores only a
   query fingerprint and declared limitations, never raw SQL or request
   payloads.

Both stages use `x-ai/grok-4.6` through the existing OpenRouter
provider with reasoning set to low and zero-data-retention routing
required. The task fails closed if no ZDR-capable endpoint is available.

## Retention and deletion

Raw excerpts are not stored. Account deletion removes that user's
`research_user_profiles` and `research_run_members` records.
`research_runs` and sanitized `research_reports` remain retained, including
single-user reports. Reports require at least one available user profile.
A single-user report states that its sample size is one and describes
individual observations with a provisional low-confidence avatar; it does not establish cross-user patterns or
population-level conclusions.

## Convex functions

- `userResearch.createRun` and `markRunRunning`: create the auditable purpose and
  processing record.
- `userResearch.listRepresentativeChats`: select bounded chats across time or
  inside a configured pre-event evidence window.
- `userResearch.getMessageExcerpt`: return bounded, text-only conversation
  excerpts after ownership verification.
- `userResearch.saveUserProfile` and `listProfiles`: persist and read structured
  restricted profiles.
- `userResearch.completeRun` and `failRun`: finalize the report, cost, coverage,
  and status.

Every function requires the dedicated `CONVEX_USER_RESEARCH_SERVICE_KEY`; none
is intended for direct browser or PM access. This key must be distinct from
`CONVEX_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and from the value used in any other environment.

## Runtime requirements

The Trigger environment must have `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`,
`CONVEX_USER_RESEARCH_SERVICE_KEY`, and the existing OpenRouter configuration
used by `lib/ai/providers.ts`. Configure the same dedicated research key on the
matching Convex deployment, but use independent values for Preview and
Production. Deploy the Trigger project after the application/Convex schema
reaches the target environment.

The Vercel Production environment also exposes a narrow PM gateway at
`/api/internal/user-research`. Configure only its Production
`PM_USER_RESEARCH_RUNNER_KEY_SHA256` with the SHA-256 digest of the scoped key
held by the PM. The gateway records `pm-gateway` as the requester, uses Vercel's
existing `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` server-side, can start only `pm-user-research`, and
returns status/output only for runs carrying its gateway tag. A completed result
includes the selected internal user IDs and aggregate report. It never returns
task payloads, other runs, worker profiles, or provider diagnostics. The PM
runner uses the fixed production URL, so Preview needs no PM gateway URL or key.

## PM invocation

Invoke `$hackerai-user-research` in Codex with the research question and cohort
criteria. Codex must not ask for a separate per-run approval or inspect Linear
state or comments before running it. A Linear issue may be supplied only when
tracking is useful. The skill uses PostHog exclusively for cohort selection and
the scoped gateway runner to start and wait for `pm-user-research`. Spend-ranked
cohorts use the available Stripe-synced properties in PostHog; PMs do not need
direct Stripe access. If the available PostHog data has accounting or mapping
limitations, label them in the aggregate output instead of blocking the run. Do
not add PMs to the Trigger organization or give them Trigger/Convex credentials.

`HACKERAI_PM_USER_RESEARCH_KEY` authenticates the scoped runner; it is not a
per-run approval mechanism and is unrelated to Linear.

For event-based questions such as churn, pass `samplingMode: "pre_event"`, a
bounded `evidenceWindowDays`, and exactly one `{ userId, anchorAt }` entry in
`evidenceAnchors` for every cohort user. `anchorAt` is the PostHog event time in
milliseconds. Behavioral evidence remains low-confidence for causal
attribution even when it immediately precedes the event; combine it with an
explicit survey or experiment before treating a friction pattern as the reason
for churn.

For comparative research, pass `comparisonGroups` with 2-4 labeled groups of
at least three users. Every cohort user must be assigned exactly once. The
gateway accepts ISO or epoch-millisecond cohort/evidence timestamps and accepts
`selectionQuerySha256` as a boundary alias for the canonical
`selectionQueryFingerprint` field. It also infers `pre_event` sampling when an
evidence window or anchors are supplied. Invalid payload responses include
bounded, non-sensitive schema issues, which the runner prints for correction.

### PostHog identity and revenue contract

- An authenticated HackerAI person's PostHog `distinct_id` is the internal
  WorkOS/Convex user ID. Cohort queries should select `distinct_id AS user_id`
  directly; no duplicate person property or email-based lookup is required.
  Display these IDs as ordinary cohort output and include them in requested
  Linear updates; do not hide or pseudonymize them.
- Every eligible successful subscription invoice emits an idempotent
  `invoice_paid` event. `amount_paid_dollars` is the payer-level amount;
  `attributed_revenue_dollars` splits that amount evenly across the active
  WorkOS members resolved for the payer, so person-level rankings must sum the
  attributed field rather than the gross field.
- `invoice_paid` instrumentation is prospective and does not backfill older
  renewals. Historical rankings should continue to prefer the Stripe-synced
  PostHog lifetime metric and document any missing customer mapping, refund,
  dispute, or pre-instrumentation coverage.
