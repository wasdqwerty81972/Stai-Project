# AGENTS.md instructions

These instructions apply to Codex and other coding agents working in this
repository. Keep them durable, repo-scoped, and free of volatile business
metrics.

## Start Here

Use [README.md](README.md) for setup and `package.json` for available commands.
`CLAUDE.md` imports this file so repository instructions have one source.

The Next.js app handles UI and HTTP requests; Convex owns persisted data;
Trigger.dev owns durable Agent runs. Ask and Agent share model-streaming logic
in `lib/api/agent-stream-runner.ts`. Trace both callers when changing that
boundary. Local and desktop clients connect through separate sandbox transports;
success on one transport does not prove the others work.

## Code Design and Maintenance

Prefer the smallest design that handles the actual requirement. Keep provider
and transport differences at their adapters and share domain logic across
callers. Extract a module when it gives a responsibility a clear owner, not just
to reduce a file's line count. Avoid speculative abstractions and pass-through
wrappers that add navigation without behavior.

Before deleting code or dependencies, check imports, scripts, framework entry
points, generated references, and dynamic loading. Treat unused-code reports as
candidates to verify. Keep refactors focused on one concern and preserve public
contracts and authorization boundaries.

## Documentation and Skills

Keep documentation for decisions, cross-service constraints, operational
procedures, and pitfalls that are hard to infer from the code. Put local
implementation explanations beside the code they explain. Avoid file catalogs,
restating types or control flow, and recording PR summaries in durable docs.
Rewrite or remove stale guidance when behavior changes.

Keep `.agents/skills/` for HackerAI-owned workflows, such as user research.
Do not vendor generic third-party coding skills or copy SDK manuals into the
repository; consult the installed dependency's docs or its official reference
when needed. Product runtime skills under `lib/ai/subagents/` and their vendored
sources under `third_party/` are a separate application dependency.

## Focused Validation

Use the smallest check that proves the changed behavior: targeted tests, lint,
and type checking for the affected scope. Test outcomes and meaningful logic,
not assertions that repeat the implementation. Preserve required commit hooks
and CI checks; avoid repeating the full suite after it passes unless new changes
or failures justify another run.

For cross-cutting changes, identify the affected paths: Ask and Agent, web and
desktop, cloud and local sandboxes, and relevant model providers. Check recovery
as well as the happy path, including cancellation, retry, and reconnect when
applicable. Apply the visual and manual verification rules below.

## Worktree Dependencies

Each checkout or worktree must have its own `node_modules` links. Never copy,
move, or manually link an installed `node_modules` tree between the main
checkout and another worktree. Sharing pnpm's global content-addressable store
is safe; sharing the installed dependency tree is not.

After creating a worktree, install its dependencies with
`corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. If the local dependency guard reports
links outside the checkout, repair that checkout with
`corepack pnpm install --force --frozen-lockfile` before running development
commands.

Do not pre-create a Convex deployment for worktrees that may only need static
checks or PR publication. `pnpm run dev:local` owns lazy local Convex setup: it
selects an existing local deployment and creates one for the current worktree
only when the Convex CLI reports that none exists. Never copy `.convex` state
between worktrees.

## HackerAI Product Direction

HackerAI is primarily built for individual security practitioners: bug bounty
hunters, solo pentesters, students, and technical builders who want practical
AI-assisted security workflows. Teams exist, but they are a secondary surface;
do not optimize product decisions, copy, onboarding, or UI around enterprise
procurement, compliance checklists, or admin-heavy workflows unless the task
explicitly asks for it.

When working on product, growth, pricing, onboarding, analytics, or UX,
optimize first for fast solo-user activation: chat-to-value, Agent mode,
local/desktop sandbox setup, cloud agent upgrade paths, file uploads, cost
clarity, referrals, and limit-pressure conversion. Favor self-serve flows,
simple language, and trust-through-transparency over enterprise sales language.

Security and trust work should be candid about current capabilities: public
source code, sandbox boundaries, subprocessors, data deletion, account security,
and any missing formal certifications. Do not imply enterprise-grade compliance,
managed security guarantees, or organizational trust claims unless they are
already implemented and documented.

For business, analytics, reliability, or production-regression questions, check
the codebase docs and instrumentation first, then use PostHog, Vercel
logs/inspect, Linear, or GitHub only when current external evidence is needed.
For production Vercel logs, use `--no-branch` unless intentionally investigating
a preview branch. Avoid hard-coding current revenue, user counts, team-share
percentages, pricing, or other volatile metrics in durable instructions; use
qualitative direction and source-of-truth references instead.

## Feature Rollouts and Measurement

For meaningful user-facing features or behavior changes, consider a PostHog
feature flag or experiment so the release can be staged and its impact
evaluated. Good candidates include new workflows, changed defaults,
onboarding or pricing changes, costly Agent behavior, operationally risky
behavior, and UX changes with uncertain impact. Do not require a flag for every
change: routine refactors, minor visual polish, accessibility fixes, and
correctness or security fixes that should reach everyone immediately are not
flag candidates.

Before implementation, document in the owning Linear issue the hypothesis,
eligible population, primary success metric, guardrail metrics, actual exposure
event, rollback condition, owner, readout or review date, and flag removal plan.
Start with internal users or an explicit allowlist, then ramp gradually. Choose
each rollout percentage based on risk, expected sample size, and current
traffic, and record it in Linear and PostHog rather than assuming a universal
percentage. Assignment must be deterministic and stable.

Keep assignment, exposure, activation, and outcome distinct. Emit exposure
only when the user actually encounters the changed experience. Analytics must
remain privacy-safe: never send prompts, targets, findings, evidence, code,
payloads, or other user content.

Shipping the implementation does not complete the experiment. Review the
PostHog readout before expanding the rollout, removing the flag, or calling the
experiment complete. Every flag needs an owner and cleanup plan so stale flags
do not accumulate.

## Pull Request Review Workflow

When a PR has been pushed and is ready for review, do not send the final
completion message until CI and CodeRabbit are complete.

Use this wait pattern:

- Poll once within 30-60 seconds after PR creation to confirm checks started.
- While CI, Vercel, or Trigger checks are active, poll every 2-3 minutes.
- When only CodeRabbit remains, poll every 3-5 minutes.
- Treat 12-15 minutes as normal CodeRabbit runtime before calling it delayed.
- If the user asks for status, report briefly, then continue waiting unless told
  to stop.

After CodeRabbit finishes:

1. Check PR checks, CodeRabbit review status, review comments, review threads,
   and issue comments.
2. Treat every CodeRabbit suggestion as a hypothesis, not automatically correct.
3. For each actionable comment:
   - If valid, fix it with the smallest appropriate change, commit, push, and
     wait for checks/CodeRabbit again.
   - If false positive or not applicable, leave a brief PR reply explaining why
     no change is needed.
   - If it is a nit, fix it when low-risk and useful; otherwise explain why it
     was skipped.
4. Repeat until CodeRabbit is complete and there are no unresolved valid
   actionable comments.

Only finish when:

- The PR is not draft.
- The branch is pushed.
- The local worktree is clean.
- Required CI checks are passing.
- CodeRabbit is complete.
- Valid CodeRabbit comments are fixed or explicitly answered.
- Visual verification is done when the PR has meaningful UI/user-visible impact.
- Manual verification steps are included when the PR is user-facing, risky,
  important, or needs human validation.
- The only remaining blocker is human review, merge approval, or the listed
  manual verification.

## Thread Coordination

Codex can use separate threads for independent work when that improves
execution, review, or verification.

Consider a separate thread when the work has a clear boundary, such as:

- a distinct feature or bug that should become its own PR;
- broad or high-risk visual QA worth an independent pass;
- a long investigation that can run while implementation or PR checks continue;
- a validation or follow-up task that does not need the current thread's full
  context.

Keep work in the current thread when it is one PR, a tightly coupled refactor, a
small follow-up, overlapping file edits, or depends heavily on context from the
current conversation.

When creating or handing off a thread, include a compact brief with: objective,
repo/worktree/branch, relevant files or PR, constraints, what not to change,
required verification, expected deliverable, and how results should be reported
back.

For multi-PR work, split threads only when each PR can be reviewed and merged
independently. Keep one parent thread responsible for coordinating scope,
avoiding overlap, and integrating results.

## Visual Verification

Use visual verification in the same PR thread by default when the PR changes UI,
chat message rendering, file/image display, onboarding, pricing, sandbox
selection, frontend routes/components, or prompt behavior that creates a
meaningful user-visible UI result.

Do not require browser/computer visual checks for backend-only, test-only,
prompt-only, CI, logging, or non-visual agent orchestration changes unless there
is a plausible user-facing UI impact.

Create a separate visual QA thread only for broad or high-risk UI changes where
independent review is worth the handoff cost, such as multi-page flows, many
responsive states, login/session setup, or visual polish passes.

## Manual Verification Notes

After checks and CodeRabbit are complete, include short manual verification
steps when the PR is user-facing, risky, important, or cannot be fully validated
by tests.

Use this for changes involving payments, auth/account security, agent or
sandbox behavior, local/desktop connections, file uploads, browser automation,
important prompt behavior, analytics, or major UI flows.

Manual steps should say:

- Where to test.
- What to do.
- What should happen.

If manual verification is not needed, say automated validation was sufficient.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
