# Development Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for local development and testing.

## Rate Limit Management

### Reset Rate Limits

Use the `reset-rate-limit.ts` script to clear rate limit counters for test users during local development.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Reset rate limits for a specific test user tier
pnpm rate-limit:reset free
pnpm rate-limit:reset pro
pnpm rate-limit:reset ultra

# Reset all test users at once
pnpm rate-limit:reset --all

# Reset by email address
pnpm rate-limit:reset user@example.com
```

#### Usage

```bash
pnpm rate-limit:reset <user>
pnpm rate-limit:reset --all
```

**Arguments:**

- `user` - Test user tier (`free` | `pro` | `ultra`) or an email address

**Options:**

- `--all` - Reset rate limits for all test users
- `--help`, `-h` - Show help message

#### How It Works

The script looks up the user's WorkOS ID, then deletes matching user-scoped Redis keys. When `ACCOUNT_IDENTITY_HMAC_SECRET` is configured locally, it also deletes the identity-scoped free quota keys for that email. Account deletion does not use this identity cleanup path.

Rate limits are stored in Upstash Redis. The script requires both WorkOS and Redis credentials.

#### Configuration

The script requires Upstash Redis and WorkOS to be configured in `.env.local`:

```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-endpoint.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token_here
WORKOS_API_KEY=your_key_here
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
ACCOUNT_IDENTITY_HMAC_SECRET=your_random_hmac_secret_here
```

If Redis is not configured, rate limiting is automatically disabled in local development.

#### Rate Limit Settings

Two different strategies are used based on subscription tier:

**Free tier — Shared fixed daily request window (resets at midnight UTC):**

- 10 request units per day (configure via `FREE_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS`)
- Ask mode costs 1 unit
- Agent mode (local sandbox only) costs 1 unit, so the default budget allows up to 10 agent requests

**Paid tiers — Cost-based token bucket (monthly, shared across all modes):**

- Pro: $25/month budget
- Pro+: $60/month budget
- Ultra: $200/month budget
- Team: $40/month budget

Token costs are calculated per request based on model pricing and actual token usage, then deducted from the monthly budget. The budget refills every 30 days. Paid users can also enable extra usage (prepaid balance) when their monthly budget is exceeded.

### Paid Daily Free Allowance Testing

Use the `paid-daily-free-allowance-dev.ts` helper to prime a paid test user for the monthly-exhausted rescue flow.

```bash
# Make the pro test user hit monthly_exhausted and clear today's rescue allowance
pnpm paid-allowance:dev prime pro

# Inspect the monthly bucket and today's allowance counters
pnpm paid-allowance:dev status pro

# Restore the paid monthly bucket and clear today's allowance
pnpm paid-allowance:dev reset pro
```

The allowance has no rollout flag and no per-request cap: every paid plan that reached its monthly limit gets up to `PAID_DAILY_FREE_ALLOWANCE_COST_LIMIT_USD` (default 0.25) of low-cost-model usage per UTC day, shared between Ask and Agent. Setting the variable to `0` disables it.

Sign in as the pro test user with the model selector on Auto, send a message, confirm the limit error keeps **Add Credits** primary, and use **Use free Ask today** or **Use free Agent today** to retry on the allowance route. Retry again to confirm there is no request cap, and use `block-cost` to confirm the cost cap blocks the next rescue. A user who picked a specific model is not offered the allowance.
