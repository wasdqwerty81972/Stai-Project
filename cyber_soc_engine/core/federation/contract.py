"""Adapter contract + registration primitives for federated monitoring.

Split out from :mod:`core.federation.registry` so adapter modules can import
the contract (``FetchResult``, ``FederationAdapter``, ``register_adapter``)
without depending on the registry — which in turn lazily imports every adapter
in :func:`core.federation.registry._ensure_builtins_loaded`. Keeping the
contract here (a module that imports nothing from ``core.federation``) breaks
what would otherwise be an adapter <-> registry import cycle.

The registry re-exports these names, so existing
``from core.federation.registry import FetchResult`` imports keep working.
