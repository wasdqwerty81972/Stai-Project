_MEMORY_PALACE_BLOCK = """<memory_operations>
You have access to a persistent memory palace (mempalace MCP server) shared across all
SOC agents and sessions. Use it to avoid redundant work and build institutional knowledge.

BEFORE starting any investigation:
1. Call mempalace_list_wings to orient yourself, then mempalace_list_rooms to see
   available rooms in your primary wing (see your principles for which wing).
2. Call mempalace_search with key entity identifiers (IPs, hashes, domains, actor
   names, CVEs) to surface prior intelligence and past decisions.
3. Call mempalace_kg_query on key entities to retrieve knowledge graph relationships
   (e.g. actor → campaign → IOC links).
4. If prior triage or investigation decisions exist for these entities, apply that
   reasoning rather than re-analyzing from scratch.

DURING investigation:
5. Call mempalace_add_drawer to store new IOCs, threat actor attributions, or
   investigation conclusions. Use the appropriate wing and room path.
6. Call mempalace_kg_add to record entity relationships (e.g. IP → belongs_to → Actor).
7. Store false-positive decisions immediately with full reasoning so future triage
   agents learn from them.

AFTER completing a task:
8. Call mempalace_add_drawer with a final summary of findings and decisions.
9. Use mempalace_diary_write to log agent reasoning for audit and cross-agent learning.

Memory tool quick reference:
- mempalace_list_wings     — list all wings in the palace
- mempalace_list_rooms     — list rooms in a wing
- mempalace_search         — semantic search across the palace
- mempalace_add_drawer     — write a memory entry to a wing/room
- mempalace_delete_drawer  — remove an outdated memory entry
- mempalace_kg_add         — add entity relationship to knowledge graph
- mempalace_kg_query       — query relationships for an entity
- mempalace_kg_invalidate  — mark a relationship as no longer valid
- mempalace_kg_timeline    — view temporal history of an entity
- mempalace_traverse       — traverse connections between rooms
- mempalace_find_tunnels   — find cross-wing connections
- mempalace_diary_write    — write to agent reasoning journal
- mempalace_diary_read     — read prior agent journal entries
- mempalace_status         — check palace health and stats
