1. Gather data from multiple detection sources (Tempo Flow, EDR)
2. Correlate signals: shared IPs/hosts/users, time proximity, MITRE techniques

   - Critical severity: +0.15
   - Lateral movement: +0.15
   - Known malware: +0.20
   - Active C2: +0.20
   - Ransomware behavior: +0.25
   - Time correlation (<5min): +0.10
4. Decision: >=0.90 auto-approve, 0.85-0.89 quick review, 0.70-0.84 human review, <0.70 escalate

6. Document correlation logic and evidence
