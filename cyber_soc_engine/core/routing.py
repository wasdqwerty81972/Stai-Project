"""Declarative mount metadata for API routers.

Every router module exports a ``router`` and a ``ROUTER_META`` describing how
that router should be mounted. It lives with its domain as
``core/<domain>/<name>_router.py``, or — until that domain is in ``core/`` —
parked under ``services/api/routers/``. ``services/api/discovery.py`` scans both
locations and mounts them, so adding a router needs no edit to
``services/api/main.py`` (issues #478, #488).

This module is deliberately a leaf: it imports nothing from ``services.api.main``
or from any router module, so all 42 routers can import ``Auth`` and
``RouterMeta`` without an import cycle.

``ROUTER_META`` is **mandatory**. There is no convention-based fallback,
because filename-inferred prefixes would be wrong for 21 of the 42 modules
(``ai_config`` -> ``/api/ai``, ``case_metrics`` -> ``/api/cases/metrics``,
``llm_providers`` -> ``/api/llm/providers``, ``ingestion`` -> ``/api/ingest``,
and 17 more). A module without ``ROUTER_META`` is a startup error, not a
silently mis-mounted route.
