"""Which services ``./start.sh`` brings up without being asked.

Stored as a plain text file at the repo root — one service name per line, ``#``
comments ignored. Resolution order mirrors ``core/platform/runtime_config.py``'s
DB -> env -> default layering: **file -> AUTOSTART_SERVICES -> DEFAULT**, with
the file as the UI-writable live source of truth and the env var as the
operator pin for CI/hardened deploys.

The storage choice is forced by bootstrapping, not taste:

- **Not the database.** ``postgres`` is itself on the list, so a list living in
  postgres cannot be read before postgres is up. Circular.
- **Not the secrets store.** It is Fernet over ``~/.vigil/secrets.enc`` —
  unreadable from bash, and an autostart list is not a secret.
- **Not ``.env``.** Bash gets it free, but the backend would have to rewrite the
  file that holds every credential in the system from a request handler, with
  no locking and no atomic replace.
