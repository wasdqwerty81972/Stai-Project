"""Single source of truth for the mempalace palace data directory (#129).

Before this module, three places picked a default for the palace path
and two of them disagreed:

  mcp-config.json             → ~/.vigil/mempalace/palace
  daemon/orchestrator.py      → ~/.mempalace/palace         (diverged)
  core/llm/harness/claude.py  → ad-hoc detection

The split-brain meant investigation snapshots written by the daemon
ended up in a different palace than the one the MCP server was
reading from. This module exposes one helper, ``get_palace_path()``,
that every caller funnels through, so the default can't drift again.

Override with ``MEMPALACE_PALACE_PATH`` when the operator wants the
palace somewhere else (shared NAS, different user, etc.). The
directory is created on first access so callers don't each need to
``mkdir -p``.
