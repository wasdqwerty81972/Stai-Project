# How a client answers the gateway, in one place. Bifrost owns the limits; what
# both processes need is the same reading of its refusals.

# 402 is terminal: the budget is gone and waiting will not bring it back.
# 429 is not: it means slow down, and a client that reports it as a budget
# failure turns a two-second wait into a failed run.
#
# The agent worker applies this in services/agent/core/limiter.ts. This is the
# Python half, and the two must not drift -- see tests/unit/llm/test_gateway_retry.py.
