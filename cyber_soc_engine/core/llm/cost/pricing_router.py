# What a model costs per token, for the agent layer. The catalog lives here and
# only here -- a second rate table in TypeScript would be one repricing away from
# disagreeing with the dashboard about what a run cost.
#
# Rates rather than a priced call: they are static per model, so the agent asks
# once and multiplies its own token counts. Pricing every call over HTTP would put
# a round trip in the loop's hot path and a failure mode in the one place that must
# never lose a spend event.
