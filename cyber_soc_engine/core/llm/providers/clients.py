"""Single source of truth for Anthropic SDK client construction.

Per GH #84 PR-B, all LLM traffic in Vigil routes through the Bifrost
gateway — including Anthropic traffic that used to bypass it. The SDK
client is pointed at Bifrost's Anthropic-compatible passthrough so
extended thinking, native prompt caching, and tool-use round-trip
unchanged while Bifrost layers in exact-hash caching, centralized cost
tracking, and budget enforcement.

Call sites that need an Anthropic client should import
``create_anthropic_client`` / ``create_async_anthropic_client`` from
this module instead of instantiating ``Anthropic()`` directly. This
keeps the gateway-routing decision in one place and makes it trivial to
audit (grep for ``Anthropic(``).

Key-validation endpoints that deliberately hit the upstream provider to
verify a user-supplied credential (e.g. ``services/api/routers/llm_providers.py``)
are the only exception and must still call ``Anthropic()`` directly.

    Normally this is Bifrost's Anthropic-compatible passthrough at
    ``/anthropic`` (alongside its OpenAI-format surface), which preserves
    extended thinking, ``cache_control`` blocks, and the cache-token usage
    counters while Bifrost layers in caching/cost tracking.

    In deployments where Bifrost cannot reach the Anthropic upstream — e.g.
    ``api.anthropic.com`` is firewalled and an internal Anthropic-compatible
    proxy (LiteLLM, etc.) must be used instead — set ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``
    to that proxy's root. Bifrost's built-in ``anthropic`` provider ignores
    its own ``network_config.base_url``, so the redirect has to happen here
    on the SDK client. When the override is set we point the SDK straight at
    it (the SDK appends ``/v1/messages`` and ``/v1/messages/count_tokens``),
    bypassing Bifrost for Anthropic traffic.
