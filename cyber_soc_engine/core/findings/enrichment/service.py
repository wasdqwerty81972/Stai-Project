"""The ``enrich()`` seam: resolve provider → dispatch → parse → stamp → persist.

Two known-imperfect behaviours are carried over from the old inline handler
rather than fixed here, so any regression stays bisectable:

* Dispatch is asymmetric — Anthropic runs on a threadpool with no retry; other
  providers get ``LLMRouter`` + retry + local-Bifrost recovery.
* The ``ai_enrichment`` write is a full replace, and ``daemon/processor`` writes
  a disjoint set of triage keys to the same column. So a daemon payload can
  satisfy the API's cache check yet render as ``undefined``, writing here wipes
  daemon triage, and the finding then leaves the daemon's
  ``ai_enrichment IS NULL`` backfill for good. ``persist=False`` is the seam for
  fixing that separately.
