"""CA-bundle trust for spawned MCP servers.

The tool servers run on httpx, which reads ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` / ``SSL_CERT_DIR``
and ignores ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`` / ``CURL_CA_BUNDLE`` — the names an operator
would have used to trust an internal CA while the servers ran on requests. An
on-prem MISP, PAN-OS or CAPE behind a private or inspecting CA would start
failing verification on nothing but a library swap, so the legacy names are
honored as aliases.

Forwarding also has to be explicit rather than inherited: ``stdio_client``
narrows the child environment to ``HOME``, ``LOGNAME``, ``PATH``, ``SHELL``,
``TERM``, ``USER`` plus the server's own ``env`` block, so a bundle set in the
backend's environment never reaches a server spawned that way.
