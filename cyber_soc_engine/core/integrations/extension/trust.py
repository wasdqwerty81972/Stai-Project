"""Single source of truth for which page-extension connector origins Vigil trusts.

One operator-set allowlist (``EXTENSION_CONNECTOR_ALLOWLIST``) is read by all
three consumers so they can't drift: the SSRF guard (mints session tokens by
calling the connector), the CSP (admits the origin into script-src/connect-src),
and the frontend trust gate. Trusting an origin here runs its code in Vigil's own
browser origin, so it's a deliberate operator control — separate from the
app-admin act of configuring a connector URL in Settings.
