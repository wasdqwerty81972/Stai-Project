"""Depends providers for the services the API builds once at startup.

``services/api/main.py``'s lifespan constructs each service onto ``app.state``;
handlers reach them through the providers here. Each provider is a module-level
function object on purpose: ``app.dependency_overrides`` keys on identity, so a
factory that minted a new closure per call could never be overridden in a test.

This module lives in ``core/`` rather than ``services/api/`` because routers
colocate with their domain (``core/<domain>/<name>_router.py``) and ``core`` must
not import ``services`` — see ``.importlinter``.
